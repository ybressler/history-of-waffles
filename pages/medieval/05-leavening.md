## The Leavening Challenge

**The Problem:**
How do you make waffles light and risen without modern chemical leavening?

**What they lacked:**
- No baking powder (invented 1843)
- No baking soda as we know it
- No precise temperature control
- No understanding of the science

**What they had:**
- Mechanical methods (air)
- Biological methods (yeast)
- Trial and error
- Time

## None (Peasant waffles)

**Flat and dense:**
- Flat, dense, cracker-like wafers
- No rise at all
- Dense and heavy texture
- Like a thin, crunchy griddle cake with honeycomb pattern

**Zero technology = zero rise**

## Whipped Egg Whites (Sometimes used)

**Mechanical leavening:**
- When eggs were available and affordable
- Provided some lift through trapped air bubbles
- Mechanical leavening only
- **Limited effectiveness** (air escapes when cooked)
- More common in wealthier households

**Better than nothing, but not great**

## Beer/Ale: The Game Changer

**The most effective pre-modern leavening method:**
- Wild yeast from beer provided the best rise
- Used in merchant-class waffles by 1650
- Required resting time (2-4 hours near the fire)
- Created small air pockets in the batter
- Made waffles slightly risen with better texture

**This deserves its own deep dive...**
