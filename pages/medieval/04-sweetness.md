## No Sweetener (Peasant reality)

**Why no sweetness?**
- Sugar was far too expensive
- **Honey was too valuable** - peasants sold it for income!
- Couldn't justify using honey when it could be sold
- Waffles eaten as a **savory meal item**, not dessert

**Like eating an unsweetened cracker**

## Honey (Merchant preference)

**The traditional sweetener:**
- Still cheaper than sugar for most merchants
- More accessible than imported sugar
- Common in 1650s merchant recipes
- Sweet but not overpowering
- Local production kept costs manageable

**The middle-class choice**

## Sugar (Wealthy only)

**The ultimate luxury:**
- Only for the wealthy by 1650
- Caribbean sugar plantations made it more accessible by mid-17th century
- Still expensive, grainy brown sugar more common
- **Refined white sugar was very rare and costly**
- Used to dust waffles at guild feasts

**Pure sugar = showing off**

# The Sweetness Ladder

1. **None** (peasants)
2. **Honey** (merchants)
3. **Brown sugar** (wealthy)
4. **White sugar** (very wealthy)

::right::

# What It Meant

**Sweetness = status**

The sweeter your waffle, the higher your social standing

Each level represented a different world of wealth and access
