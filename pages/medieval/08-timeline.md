## What They Still Lacked

**Compared to modern waffles:**
- No chemical leavening (baking powder/baking soda)
- No refined white sugar (expensive, grainy brown sugar more common)
- No temperature control (inconsistent heat from open fire)
- No thick, fluffy texture (no chemical leavening = denser waffle)
- No electric waffle irons (had to manage heat manually over coals)

**But they had the core concepts down**

## What Made This Period Special

**The convergence:**
- Required specialized, expensive equipment (waffle irons from blacksmiths)
- Symbol of urban, commercial culture vs. rural peasant life
- Represented Dutch/Belgian culinary innovation
- **Bridge between medieval and early modern baking techniques**
- Foundation for modern waffle culture

**Everything modern came from this foundation**
