## Peasant Consumption Patterns

**Extremely rare occasions:**
- Festival days only (religious holidays, harvest festivals)
- Town market treats purchased from street vendors
- **Maybe once or twice per year maximum**
- When working in wealthy households (got to eat leftovers)
- **Almost never made at home** (couldn't afford waffle irons)

**A waffle was a special memory, not a regular meal**

## Merchant Class Consumption

**More frequent, but still special:**
- Guild feasts and celebrations
- Business celebrations and contracts
- Religious holidays
- Street vendor purchases during market days
- **Still a treat, not daily food** - perhaps a few times per year
- More frequent than peasants but not common

**Regular access but maintained special status**

# Street Vendors

**The original street food:**
- Hot waffles sold in town markets
- Rolled into cones for easy eating
- Dusted with sugar or drizzled with honey (if paying extra)
- **Eaten while walking through the market**
- Popular urban street food
- Accessible to those who could afford a small luxury

## Guild Feasts and Merchant Tables

**Formal dining:**
- Served at the end of formal meals
- Part of the dessert course
- Accompanied by sweet wine or spiced ale
- Sometimes with rose water or orange blossom water
- Fresh fruit preserves on the side
- **A display of wealth and refinement**

**This was about status as much as taste**

## Why Urban Environments?

**Waffles required cities:**
- Blacksmiths to make waffle irons
- Concentrated customer base
- Market infrastructure
- Trade networks for ingredients
- Middle class with disposable income
- **Street food culture**

**Rural peasants didn't have the infrastructure or economy for waffles**
