## Rye Flour (Peasant staple)

**Bottom of the hierarchy:**
- Dark, grainy texture
- Strong, earthy flavor
- Most affordable and common
- What peasants had access to
- Made dense, heavy waffles

**This was survival food, not luxury**

## Mixed Grain (Rye + Wheat)

**Step up from pure rye:**
- Rye/wheat blend for those who could afford it
- More refined taste than pure rye
- Still relatively affordable
- Better texture than pure rye

**The compromise option**

## Fine White Wheat Flour

**Status symbol:**
- Smooth, refined texture
- Mild, pleasant flavor
- **Expensive luxury item**
- Required for merchant-class waffles
- Pure wheat (not whole grain) was a sign of wealth
- Only urban middle class and above could afford

**White flour = wealth and refinement**
