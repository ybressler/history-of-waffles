# `Peasants in an Interior`
*Adriaen van Ostade (1661)*

## Who Ate Peasant Waffles?

**Almost never actual peasants at home:**

# Peasant Waffle Ingredients

**What they could afford:**
- Rye or mixed grain flour
- Water only (no milk, eggs, butter)
- Salt
- **No sweetener at all**
- **No leavening**

::right::

# The Result

**Characteristics:**
- Dense, grainy, cracker-like
- Flat and crispy
- Bland, unsweetened
- Strong, earthy rye flavor
- Eaten as a **meal item**, not dessert

## Peasant Waffle Serving

**Plain and practical:**
- Maybe with a bit of lard or drippings
- Honey if very lucky (rare luxury - they sold honey for income)
- Cheese if available
- As a side to soup or pottage

**Think:** Unsweetened cracker with a honeycomb pattern

# Merchant Waffle Ingredients

**Status symbols:**

- Multiple eggs (3-4 yolks)
- Cream or whole milk

::right::

# The Result

**Much better:**
- Richer, more tender texture
- **Slightly risen** (beer yeast!)
- Crispy outside, softer inside
- Golden color from eggs/butter
- **Sweet** from honey/sugar
- Complex fermented flavor

# The difference was staggering

Bland cracker vs. sweet, rich, risen treat
