## The Evolution in Five Steps

**Medieval waffles evolved through class and technology:**

1. **Peasant waffles** - Bland, dense, unleavened crackers, rarely eaten
2. **Merchant waffles** - Eggs, butter, cream, and **beer yeast** for superior texture
3. **Beer was the game-changer** - Liquid, flavor, AND leavening
4. **Low Countries tradition** - Belgium/Netherlands became the foundation
5. **Chemical leavening** - 19th century made fluffy modern waffles possible

## The Class Divide Defined Everything

**Ingredients showed status:**
- Flour: Rye → Mixed grain → White wheat
- Sweetness: None → Honey → Sugar
- Leavening: None → Egg whites → Beer yeast
- Richness: Water → Milk → Cream + eggs + butter

**Each upgrade marked a higher social class**

## What Made Merchant Waffles Revolutionary

**The beer leavening technique:**
- Only leavening technology available before 1843
- Created the first "risen" waffles
- Distinguished merchant from peasant waffles
- Foundation for Low Countries waffle tradition
- **Led directly to modern Belgian waffles**

**This was the innovation that mattered**

## Why the Low Countries?

**The perfect convergence:**
- All five essential requirements met
- **Plus** beer culture for leavening innovation
- Strong culinary tradition
- Central location for trade

**The birthplace of modern waffle culture**

# From urban street food to global phenomenon

This is where it all began

## What Came Next

**The foundation was laid:**
- Chemical leavening (1843) made waffles fluffier
- Sugar became cheaper and more accessible
- Belgian waffle traditions spread worldwide
- Electric waffle irons democratized production
- Modern waffles became possible

**But it all started with beer in medieval Low Countries**

# Medieval waffles were never about peasants

They were always urban, commercial, and aspirational
