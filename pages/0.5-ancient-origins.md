# Grinding Grain into Flour

**This limestone statuette captures the daily labor of ancient food preparation.** A woman kneels at a grinding stone, transforming grain into flour - the essential ingredient for all bread-like foods, including early wafer cakes.

This backbreaking work was the foundation of ancient baking culture.

## Ancient Greece (~1200-600 BCE)
**Obelios**: Wafer cakes cooked between two hot metal plates
- Earliest known "waffle iron" concept
- Made with flour, water, sometimes cheese
- Pressed flat, creating first geometric patterns
- Eaten at religious ceremonies

# What They Had

- Metal working technology
- Hinged cooking implements
- Decorated metal plates
- Religious symbols pressed into cakes
- Flour, water, honey, eggs

# What They Didn't Have

- Deep pockets (shallow patterns only)
- Leavening agents (no yeast yet)
- Sugar (honey only)
- Street food culture (ceremonial use)
- Modern waffle texture

# `Roman Bakehouse in Pompeii`
*This 1817 engraving shows the remarkably preserved oven and mills discovered in the House of Pansa. When Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE, it froze this bakery in time - complete with a loaf of bread still bearing the baker's mark "SILIGO • CRANIIE • CICER" indicating its ingredients.*

Evidence of Rome's sophisticated commercial baking industry.

## Ancient Rome (~500 BCE - 400 CE)
Continued Greek wafer traditions
- Added honey and eggs for richness
- Used decorated metal plates (proto-waffle irons)
- Street vendors sold them in markets
- First commercialization of wafer cakes

# From Religious Ritual to Street Food

# Ancient Wafers

- Thin (like communion wafers)
- Unleavened (no yeast)
- Simple ingredients
- Religious/ceremonial use
- Shallow patterns

::right::

# Medieval Waffles (later)

- Thicker and crispier
- Beer/yeast leavening
- Richer ingredients
- Street food
- Deep pockets

## The Monastery Connection (400-1200 CE)
After Rome fell, monasteries preserved wafer-making
- Communion wafer tradition kept technique alive
- Irons became decorated with Christian imagery
- Gradual transition from religious to secular use
- By 1200s: wafer vendors at markets and fairs

# The Evolution Path
Ancient wafers → Communion wafers → Medieval waffles → Belgian waffles

# The Foundation Was Set

**From this humble beginning** - grinding grain by hand on stone - humanity developed the techniques that would eventually create waffles.

Thousands of years of grain grinding, metal working, and patterned cooking all led to the waffle we know today.
