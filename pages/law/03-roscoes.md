layout: fact

## The Setup

**Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles:**
- Famous Southern California chain
- Federally registered trademark
- Beloved cultural institution

**2008: Darnell Johnson opens in Chicago:**
- Name: "Rosscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles"
- Note the double "s"
- No affiliation with California chain
- **Seemed like a good idea at the time**

## The Lawsuit

**Roscoe's response:**
- Sued for trademark infringement
- Johnson quickly changed name to "Chicago's Home of Chicken and Waffles"
- Court proceedings continued over logo similarities

**The legal principle:**
- You can't just add an extra letter and call it different
- "But there's TWO s's!" is not a legal defense
- Trademark law doesn't work that way

1. Chicken and waffles is serious business
2. California takes its waffles very seriously
3. Adding letters to famous names doesn't fool anyone
4. Especially doesn't fool trademark lawyers

**Would not have worked:**
- Starbuckss
- McDonaldss
- Rosccooe's
