## The Allegation (2022)

**Jessica Collins sued Waffle House:**
- Florida federal court
- Over the "All-Star Special" breakfast combo
- Advertised for $10
- **Down from a "reference price" of $13.25**

**Sounds reasonable so far...**

## The Problem

**False reference pricing:**
- The $13.25 was based on buying items separately
- But items were never actually sold together at that price
- This is advertising a discount from a price that never existed
- **The discount was... imaginary?**

## The Claim

**Collins argued:**
- Customers weren't getting the "bargain" they thought
- Sought class action status for multiple states
- Alleged breach of warranty and unjust enrichment

**The "crime":**
- The math made it look like a better deal than it was
- Not fraud, not deception
- Just... creative marketing math

## The Absurdity Level

**Let's review:**
- Nobody was charged more than advertised
- Nobody got less food than promised
- The price was clearly stated: $10
- **The crime: Making $10 sound like a good deal**

**This is what peak American litigation looks like**
