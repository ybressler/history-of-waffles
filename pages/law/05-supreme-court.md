## The Legal Question

**The issue before the Court:**

Can the EEOC sue on behalf of an employee who signed an arbitration agreement?

**Waffle House's argument:**
- Baker agreed to arbitration
- EEOC can't override private contracts
- Case should go to arbitration, not court

**EEOC's argument:**
- We represent the public interest, not just Baker
- Arbitration agreements don't bind us
- We can seek remedies for discrimination
