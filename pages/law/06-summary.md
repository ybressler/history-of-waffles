## The 2014 World Cup Boycott

**Waffle House's patriotic confusion:**
- During US vs. Belgium match
- Announced boycott on Belgian waffles
- Told TMZ: "We support America. We don't support Belgian Waffles."

**The problem:**
- Belgian waffles are American (1962 World's Fair)
- So they boycotted an American food while being "patriotic"
- **If you wanted to boycott Belgium, give up French fries**

**Legal status:** Not a lawsuit, just hilarious corporate confusion

- Brand recognition
- Grocery store shelf space
- Apparently worth extensive litigation

## The Waffle Iron Incident

**Not a lawsuit, but legendary:**

- **Had poured waffle batter directly into the toaster**

**Result:** Not everything that involves heat can cook waffles
