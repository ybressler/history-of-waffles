## The Five Essential Requirements

**A waffle needs these elements to exist:**

1. **Metal waffle irons** - Requires blacksmiths, expensive specialized equipment
2. **Urban environment** - Street markets, trade networks, concentrated customers
3. **Surplus ingredients** - Flour, liquid, enrichments (eggs, butter, sweeteners)
4. **Street food culture** - Mobile vendors, fresh hot food, social eating
5. **A middle class** - People with disposable income for treats

# Why Medieval Europe?

These five elements all came together in growing medieval cities

**Especially the Dutch/Belgian Low Countries (1200s-1600s)**

## The Bottom Line

**Waffles are fundamentally urban, commercial food**

They emerged when cities, metalworking, trade, and a middle class converged.

Not a peasant food. Not a home-cooked meal.

**A product of civilization itself.**
