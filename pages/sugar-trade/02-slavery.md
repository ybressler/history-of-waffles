## The Caribbean Sugar Plantation System

**Built on enslaved labor:**
- **1600s-1800s:** Massive expansion of sugar plantations
- **Millions of enslaved Africans** forced to work sugar fields
- Brutal conditions, short life expectancy
- **The Triangle Trade:** Europe → Africa → Caribbean → Europe
- Sugar wealth built European economies

**The sweetness in your waffle had a human cost**

## The Scale of the Trade

**Staggering numbers:**
- **~12 million Africans** forcibly transported
- **~2 million died** during the Middle Passage
- Peak sugar production: 1650-1850
- Major producers: Jamaica, Barbados, Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Cuba
- **European powers**: Britain, France, Spain, Netherlands, Portugal

**This wasn't a side effect - it was the system**

## Why Sugar Required Slavery

**The brutal economics:**
- Sugar cane is labor-intensive to grow and harvest
- Processing had to be done quickly after harvest
- Required massive workforce
- European colonizers refused to do the work
- **Enslavement was seen as "economically necessary"**

**There was nothing necessary about it - it was a choice**

# We can't enjoy waffle history without acknowledging this

## The Legacy

**Still with us today:**
- Wealth disparities trace back to this trade
- Caribbean nations still recovering economically
- Systemic racism rooted in this history
- **Modern luxury built on historical suffering**

**When we talk about "accessible sugar," remember what made it accessible**
