# 0. What is a waffle?

## The Five Essential Requirements

**A waffle needs these elements to exist:**
1. **Metal waffle irons** - Requires blacksmiths, expensive specialized equipment
2. **Urban environment** - Street markets, trade networks, concentrated customers
3. **Surplus ingredients** - Flour, liquid, enrichments (eggs, butter, sweeteners)
4. **Street food culture** - Mobile vendors, fresh hot food, social eating
5. **A middle class** - People with disposable income for treats

## Why Medieval Europe? (1200s-1600s)
These five elements all came together in growing medieval cities, especially the Dutch/Belgian Low Countries.
**Bottom line:** Waffles are fundamentally urban, commercial food - they emerged when cities, metalworking, trade, and a middle class converged.
